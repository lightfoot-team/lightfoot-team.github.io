# Our Solution

LightFoot is a simple feature flag management platform with built-in, flag-enriched observability. LightFootâ€™s flag management includes the ability to toggle flags as well as percentage-based and targeted rollouts. LightFoot is designed for small development teams getting started with feature flags and interested in increasing the safety of their rollouts with observability.

As the table illustrates, LightFoot aims to combine the benefits of open-source standards, built-in observability, and infrastructure and data ownership. LightFoot is for teams that want simple feature flag management and observability and do not need advanced features like A/B testing, canary deployments, and user behavior analytics.
